Lately I‚Äôve been wearing sweatpants every day because my 14 jeans feel slightly tight and i‚Äôve been addicted to an elastic waistband for the last year. When ordering these jeans, I read the reviews, looked at the size chart, and decided I‚Äôd probably need a 16. I don‚Äôt like my skinny jeans to be a second skin. I like them tight, but not where you have to do magic tricks to get in them. I was discouraged, thinking I had gone up a size, but I ordered both the 14 and 16 with the intent to return whichever one didn‚Äôt work. When they came, I hopefully tried on the 14 first and THEY FIT üéâüåüüòÉ! In fact, they look a little saggy. So I‚Äôd totally recommend ordering your normal size- they have a lot of stretch to them. And if you‚Äôre feeling brave, maybe even try the next size down ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

Lately I‚Äôve been wearing sweatpants every day because my 14 jeans feel slightly tight and i‚Äôve been addicted to an elastic waistband for the last year. When ordering these jeans, I read the reviews, looked at the size chart, and decided I‚Äôd probably need a 16. I don‚Äôt like my skinny jeans to be a second skin. I like them tight, but not where you have to do magic tricks to get in them. I was discouraged, thinking I had gone up a size, but I ordered both the 14 and 16 with the intent to return whichever one didn‚Äôt work. When they came, I hopefully tried on the 14 first and THEY FIT üéâüåüüòÉ! In fact, they look a little saggy. So I‚Äôd totally recommend ordering your normal size- they have a lot of stretch to them. And if you‚Äôre feeling brave, maybe even try the next size down ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

Lately I‚Äôve been wearing sweatpants every day because my 14 jeans feel slightly tight and i‚Äôve been addicted to an elastic waistband for the last year. When ordering these jeans, I read the reviews, looked at the size chart, and decided I‚Äôd probably need a 16. I don‚Äôt like my skinny jeans to be a second skin. I like them tight, but not where you have to do magic tricks to get in them. I was discouraged, thinking I had gone up a size, but I ordered both the 14 and 16 with the intent to return whichever one didn‚Äôt work. When they came, I hopefully tried on the 14 first and THEY FIT üéâüåüüòÉ! In fact, they look a little saggy. So I‚Äôd totally recommend ordering your normal size- they have a lot of stretch to them. And if you‚Äôre feeling brave, maybe even try the next size down ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

Lately I‚Äôve been wearing sweatpants every day because my 14 jeans feel slightly tight and i‚Äôve been addicted to an elastic waistband for the last year. When ordering these jeans, I read the reviews, looked at the size chart, and decided I‚Äôd probably need a 16. I don‚Äôt like my skinny jeans to be a second skin. I like them tight, but not where you have to do magic tricks to get in them. I was discouraged, thinking I had gone up a size, but I ordered both the 14 and 16 with the intent to return whichever one didn‚Äôt work. When they came, I hopefully tried on the 14 first and THEY FIT üéâüåüüòÉ! In fact, they look a little saggy. So I‚Äôd totally recommend ordering your normal size- they have a lot of stretch to them. And if you‚Äôre feeling brave, maybe even try the next size down ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
